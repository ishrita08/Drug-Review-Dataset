# Drug-Review-Dataset

# IntroductionðŸ“Œ
This is an innovative machine learning project that utilizes patient reviews with many other attributes to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of different drugs in treating specific conditions. By training on a vast dataset of patient experiences, the model can provide insightful ratings for the available drugs, based on their real-world usage.

The project demonstrates the power of advanced machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from unstructured data, ultimately enabling more informed decision-making in the healthcare industry.
